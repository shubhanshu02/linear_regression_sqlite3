# Linear Regression

This project tries to implement a linear regression model using the Vowpal Wabbit library that follows in-database machine learning paradigm. 

The model is trained on a SQLite3 database and the predictions are made on the test data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- Vowpal Wabbit
- SQLite3

## Usage

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:shubhanshu02/  linear_regression_sqlite3.git
   ```

2. Install the requirements

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the `main.py` file

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Data Source

The data used in the SQLite3 database is from the Vowpal Wabbit tutorial as given [here](https://vowpalwabbit.org/docs/vowpal_wabbit/python/latest/tutorials/cmd_linear_regression.html)
